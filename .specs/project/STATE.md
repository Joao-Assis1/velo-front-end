# Project State

## Decisions Made
- **Stack**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI (as requested by user)
- **State Management**: React Context API (current implementation)
- **Routing**: Client-side navigation via state (to be upgraded to Next.js routing)
- **Styling**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Date Handling**: date-fns with ptBR locale
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

## Open Questions / Blockers
- **Backend Integration**: No backend API defined yet - need to define endpoints for data fetching
- **Authentication Strategy**: Current implementation is role-based simulation - need real auth with JWT/sessions
- **Data Persistence**: Currently using ephemeral state - need to integrate with backend/API
- **File Structure**: Current monolithic App.tsx needs to be broken down into components
- **Next.js Migration**: Need to migrate from Vite + React to Next.js framework
- **Form Handling**: No form validation library implemented yet
- **Testing**: No tests currently written
